Public Demandjump React Component Library and UIKit based on Material Design with MaterialUI.

## Storybook

See the components live at [Our Storybook](https://demandjump.github.io/trinity/)

-- Storybook is deployed with github actions via the .github/workflows/storybook.yaml file and the npm package @storybook/storybook-deployer and the package.json script:
     "deploy-storybook": "storybook-to-ghpages"

-- I had to add a personal access token to the github action called GH_TOKEN for the action to be able to deploy the storybook.
